### Usage

Detailed guidelines and code examples for using each anomaly detection technique are provided in the respective sections below.

## Anomaly Detection Techniques

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- **Description:** SVM is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. In this project, we adapt SVM for anomaly detection.
- **Usage:** Learn how to implement SVM-based anomaly detection with code examples and usage instructions.
- **References:** [Link to SVM resources](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)

### Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

- **Description:** LOF is a density-based algorithm that identifies local outliers in a dataset.
- **Usage:** Discover how to apply LOF for anomaly detection with practical examples and configuration details.
- **References:** [Link to LOF resources](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/neighbors/plot_lof_outlier_detection.html)

### Isolation Forest

- **Description:** Isolation Forest is an ensemble-based algorithm that excels at isolating anomalies.
- **Usage:** Explore Isolation Forest for anomaly detection through code samples and usage guidelines.
- **References:** [Link to Isolation Forest resources](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html)

### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

- **Description:** DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that can be used for anomaly detection by identifying points not assigned to any cluster.
- **Usage:** Learn how to configure and utilize DBSCAN for anomaly detection using provided examples.
- **References:** [Link to DBSCAN resources](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html)

### Statistical Techniques

In this section, we cover statistical techniques for anomaly detection, including:

#### Percentile Method

#### Standard Deviation

- **Description:** Describe how standard deviation can be employed to detect anomalies in data.
- **Usage:** Demonstrate how to implement standard deviation-based anomaly detection with code samples.
- **References:** [Link to standard deviation resources](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html)

#### Interquartile Range

- **Description:** Explain the interquartile range method's role in anomaly detection.
- **Usage:** Offer code examples and instructions for applying the interquartile range technique.
- **References:** [Link to interquartile range resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range)
